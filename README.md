# Fluid typography

I created this project to teach my Integrify peers about fluid typography. This reflects knowledge I have gathered from many sources (mostly from [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/)) as well as from personal experience.

Please note: the explanations are included as comments in the CSS file.
